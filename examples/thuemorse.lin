0 ( \clr dip ( ( 0+ dup ! ++ ) map ) ' () join ) 10 e* out



# EXPLANATION

Outputs the Thue-Morse sequence.

- `0` is the initial condition.
- `(...) 10 e* out` executes the given lambda 10 times and outputs the result.
- `\clr dip` clears the stack except for the top item.
- `( (...) map ) ' () join` executes the lambda on each digit in the number at the top of the stack and joins the result.
- `0+ dup ! ++` turns 0 into 01 and 1 into 10.
