1 1 ( over outln swap over + ) 50 e*



# EXPLANATION
This outputs the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.

- `1 1` serves as the initial condition.
- `(...) 50 e*` executes the lambda while the top item on the stack is not 0.

Within the lambda:

- `over outln` duplicates the second from top of stack and outputs it.
- `swap over +` adds the top 2 Fibonacci numbers. Visualized, this does `[ a b ] => [ b a ] => [ b a b ] => [ b a+b ]`
