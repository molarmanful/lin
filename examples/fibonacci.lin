1N 1N ( over outln swap over + ) $I e*



# EXPLANATION

This outputs Fibonacci numbers.

- `1N 1N` serves as the initial condition.
- `(...) $I e*` executes the lambda infinitely.
- `over outln` duplicates the second from top of stack and outputs it.
- `swap over +` adds the top 2 Fibonacci numbers.
